            <h2>Margaret “Meg” March </h2>
            <p>When the novel begins, Meg, the oldest sister, is 16 years old. When her mother is away, she is portrayed as a beauty who handles the family. She is the most attractive of the sisters, with long brown hair, blue eyes, and lovely hands. Meg lives up to the standards of the period; she is already a near-perfect "little woman" in the eyes of the world. While still living at home before marrying John Brooke, she frequently lectures her younger sisters in order to guarantee that they grow up to be "little women." 
               Meg works for the Kings, a rich local family, as a governess. Meg makes her entrance into high society as a result of their father's family's social position, but is lectured by her friend and neighbor, Theodore ("Laurie") Laurence, for behaving like a snob. Laurie's teacher, John Brooke, marries Meg. Margaret "Daisy" Brooke and John Laurence "Demi" Brooke are their twins. And Little Men, the sequel, references a newborn daughter named Josephine "Josie". 
               
               "Democratic domesticity takes maturity, strength, and most all, a strong identity, which Meg lacks," says Sarah Elbert. Others feel Alcott does not mean to make fun of Meg for her everyday existence, and that she writes about her in loving detail, dripping with sentimentality.               
            <h2>Josephine “Jo” March </h2>
            <p>The novel's protagonist and the second-oldest March sister. The character Jo, who aspires to be a writer, is based on Louisa May Alcott, making the novel semi-autobiographical. Jo has a short fuse and a quick tongue, despite her best efforts to keep both under control. She is a tomboy who is irritated by the numerous restrictions placed on women and girls. In real life, she despises romance and wants nothing more than to keep her family together.

               Jo enjoys reading and writing books. She writes short stories and composes plays for her sisters to perform. She first dismisses the notion of marriage and romance, believing that it will disintegrate her family and alienate her from her adoring sisters. She meets Friedrich Bhaer, a German professor, while pursuing a literary career in New York City. Laurie proposes marriage to Jo when she returns home, but she declines, reaffirming her independence. Another reason for Laurie's rejection is because his love for Jo is more of a sisterly love than a romantic love, a distinction that he couldn't understand because he was "only a boy," as Alcott puts it in the book.             
               
           </p>
           <h2>Elizabeth “Beth” March</h2>
           <p>Beth, who is 13 at the time the novel begins, is described as sweet, gentle, shy, quiet, honest, and musical. She is the family's pianist and the shyest March sibling. She is the family's peacemaker, gently scolding her sisters when they dispute, and she is infused with quiet wisdom. Beth's sisters are starting to leave home as they get older, but she has no desire to leave her home or family. Jo is especially attached to her: when Beth has scarlet fever after visiting the Hummel’s, Jo takes care of her for the most part and seldom leaves her side. Beth recovers from the acute illness, but her health remains impaired for the rest of her life.

            Beth realizes as she grows older that her time with her loved ones is dwindling. Finally, the family comes to terms with the fact that Beth will not live for much longer. They create a special room for her, complete with all her favorite things, including her kittens, piano, Father's books, Amy's sketches, and her cherished dolls. She never sits still; she knits and sews for the kids that pass by on their way to and from school. However, she ultimately puts down her sewing needle, claiming that it has become "heavy." Beth's final illness has a profound impact on her sisters, particularly Jo, who vows to live her life with greater respect and care for everybody. The death of dear Beth is the most tragic loss in Little Women. She is a woman who's described as "the novel's greatest achievement is self-sacrifice. Beth knows she is giving up her life because it has only had a private, home purpose for her."
            
          </p>

          <h2>Amy Curtis March</h2>
          <p>Amy is the family's so-called baby and youngest sister; she is 12 years old when the story begins. She is characterized as a "typical snow-maiden" with curly golden hair and blue eyes, "pale and slim," and "always carrying herself" like a respectable young lady, she is the family's artist. But Amy can be egotistical and self-centered, despite her love for her family, because she is the youngest. Her middle name is Curtis, and she is the only March sister who uses her full name instead of a diminutive.
            Her aunt chooses her to accompany her on a trip to Europe, where she matures and decides on the level of her creative talent and how to steer her adult life. During her extended tour, she meets "Laurie" Laurence and his grandfather. Amy is the sister who is least prone to self-denial and sacrifice. She is well-behaved in social situations and appears to be at peace with herself. According to critic Martha Saxton, the author was never completely comfortable with Amy's moral evolution, and her success in life felt haphazard. Amy's morals, on the other hand, appears to develop throughout her youth and early adulthood, and she is capable of confidently and justly putting Laurie in his place when she perceives he is wasting his life on enjoyable activities. Amy is ultimately shown to work really hard in order to achieve her goals in life and to make the most of her success while she has it.
