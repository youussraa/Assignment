            <h2>Elizabeth Bennet </h2>
            <p>Elizabeth (or "Lizzy"), the novel's protagonist, is the second eldest of the five Bennet daughters. Elizabeth is quick-witted, humorous, and intellectual, and she has perfected the art of being nice in public while expressing her strong beliefs privately. Elizabeth is a keen watcher of people, but she also values her ability to make snap decisions and create opinions rapidly. Her mother and younger sisters' indelicate and impolite behavior frequently embarrasses her, and although being well aware of her family's financial situation, she still wishes to marry for love rather than convenience. When Elizabeth overhears Mr. Darcy criticizing herself, she is immediately outraged. When Elizabeth befriends an officer, Wickham, who informs her of Darcy's mistreatment of him, her suspicions about him are confirmed. Elizabeth realizes that first impressions can be deceiving over time, but she is still enraged at Darcy for interfering in her sister Jane's burgeoning romance with Bingley. Elizabeth realizes that her prejudices have clouded her observation and that her affections may be deeper than she first imagined after Darcy's failed proposal and subsequent explanation of his past.
            </p>
            <h2>Fitzwilliam Darcy </h2>
            <p>The novel's male protagonist and, for a time, Elizabeth's nemesis is Darcy, a wealthy landowner. He is a cold, arrogant man who is haughty, taciturn, and somewhat antisocial when he initially enters society and does not endear himself to anyone. He tries to separate Jane Bennet and Charles Bingley, mistakenly believing that Jane Bennet is simply wanting his friend’s money. Jane's sister Elizabeth, for whom Darcy has been developing love, is enraged by his meddling. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, but his proposal highlights Elizabeth's lower social and financial status, infuriating Elizabeth, who replies by displaying the extent of her hate for Darcy. Mr. Darcy is a fundamentally decent and sympathetic guy, despite his pride, stubbornness, and status-consciousness. His hatred for Wickham is shown to be based on Wickham's intrigues and attempted seduction of Darcy's sister, and he shows his kindness by paying for Wickham's elopement with Lydia Bennet to become a marriage. His pride fades as his compassion grows, and when he proposes to Elizabeth for the second time, he does it with respect and understanding.
           </p>
           <h2>Jane Bennet </h2>
           <p>Jane Bennet is the eldest Bennet sister and is usually regarded as the nicest and most attractive. Jane is a gentle and cheerful person who believes the best of everyone, which backfires when she overlooks Caroline Bingley's devious attempts to divide Jane and Mr. Bingley. Jane's romantic mishaps educate her to be more realistic about other people's motivations, but she never loses love for Bingley, and when he returns to her life, she happily accepts his proposal. Jane serves as a counterweight to Elizabeth, being soft and trustworthy in contrast to Lizzy's sharp tongue and keen observation. Despite this, the sisters have a real affection for one another and a cheerful disposition.
          </p>

          <h2>Charles Bingley </h2>
          <p>It's no surprise that Mr. Bingley falls in love with Jane because they have similar temperaments. While he is of ordinary intelligence and a little naive, he is also open-hearted, always polite, and naturally charming, which sets him apart from his reserved, arrogant friend Darcy. Bingley falls in love with Jane at first sight but departs Meryton after being persuaded by Darcy and Caroline of Jane's disinterest. When Bingley reappears later in the novel, he proposes to Jane after learning that his loved ones were "mistaken”. While both couples were kept apart despite being well-matched, Jane and Bingley's separation was caused by external causes (manipulative relatives), whereas Lizzy and Darcy's early strife was caused by their own personal traits 
         </p>

         <h2>William Collins </h2>
         <p>The Bennet’s' estate is subject to an entail, which means it will be inherited by their cousin, Mr. Collins, who is their closest male relative. Collins is an awkward and moderately obnoxious man who believes himself to be wonderfully fascinating and brilliant. He is a self-important, deeply foolish parson. He plans to make up for the inheritance predicament by marrying the eldest Bennet daughter, but after learning that Jane is going to become engaged, he focuses on Elizabeth instead. It takes a lot of persuasion to persuade him that she isn't interested in him, and he instead marries her friend Charlotte. Mr. Collins takes great delight in Lady Catherine de Bourgh's patronage, and his sycophantic attitude and pretentious devotion to rigid social standards ensures that they get along splendidly.
        </p>

        <h2>Lydia Bennet </h2>
        <p>Lydia, the youngest of five Bennet sisters, is regarded as the most pampered and impetuous of the family. She's obnoxious, arrogant, and preoccupied with flirting with patrolman. She acts rashly and has no hesitation about eloping with Wickham. Lydia suddenly finds herself in a hurriedly planned marriage to Wickham, arranged to restore her purity, despite the reality that the match will very certainly be unhappy for Lydia. 
       </p>

       <h2>George Wickham </h2>
       <p>Wickham, a charming militiaman, approaches Elizabeth right away and tells her of his abuse by Darcy. The two continue to flirt, yet it never truly takes off. His nice personality is revealed to be simply superficial: he is actually greedy and selfish, having squandered all of Darcy's father's money and then attempting to seduce Darcy's sister in order to gain access to her money. Later, he elopes with Lydia Bennet with no intention of marrying her but is persuaded by Darcy's persuasion and money to do so.
      </p>

      <h2>Charlotte Lucas </h2>
      <p>Charlotte, Elizabeth's closest friend, is the daughter of another Meryton noble family. She's physically unattractive and, despite being sweet and witty, she's twenty-seven and unmarried. She accepts Mr. Collins' marriage proposal because she isn't as romantic as Lizzy, but she carves out her own peaceful area of their existence together.
     </p>

     <h2>Caroline Bingley </h2>
     <p>Caroline is a pretentious social climber who aspires to be even wealthier. She's cold and preconceived, and while she may be charming, she's incredibly self-aware and judgmental. Her tone changes dramatically when she realizes her brother Charles is serious about Jane, and she manipulates her brother into believing Jane is uninterested. Caroline also sees Elizabeth as a rival for Darcy, and she constantly tries to outdo her, both to impress Darcy and to set up her brother with Georgiana, Darcy's sister. She fails on all fronts in the end.
    </p>

    <h2>Mr. and Mrs. Bennet </h2>
    <p>The Bennet’s are a long-married and long-suffering couple: she's high-strung and consumed with marrying off her daughters, while he's laid-back and wry. Mrs. Bennet's concerns are legitimate, but she goes too far in favor of her daughters, which is one of the reasons why both Jane and Elizabeth come close to missing out on good unions. She frequently goes to bed with "nervous complaints," especially after Lydia's elopement, but news of her daughters' marriages cheers her enormously.
   </p>

   <h2>Lady Catherine de Bourgh  </h2>
   <p>Lady Catherine, the domineering mistress of the Rosing’s estate, is the novel's only aristocratic character (as opposed to landed gentry). Lady Catherine is demanding and snobbish, and she expects to get her way at all times, which is why Elizabeth's confident manner upsets her from the start. Lady Catherine likes to talk about how accomplished she "might have been," yet she is neither accomplished nor talented. Her master plan is to marry her ill daughter Anne to her nephew Darcy, and when she hears that he is to marry Elizabeth instead, she rushes to meet Elizabeth and demand that such a marriage never take place. Elizabeth dismisses her, and instead of her visit destroying any links between the two, it strengthens them, her visit serves to confirm to both Elizabeth and Darcy that the other is still very much interested.
