                <p class="card__price-value">Thomas Niles, Louisa May Alcott's publisher, suggested that she create a book about females that would appeal to a broad audience in 1868. She resisted at first, preferring to publish a collection of short stories instead. Niles pushed her to write the girls' book first, and her father, Amos Bronson Alcott, encouraged her to do so as well. Louisa May Alcott said she'd give it a shot. However, she later admitted that she did not believe she could create a successful book for females and that she did not enjoy the process of writing it. Little Women was written in a record-breaking amount of time by Louisa May Alcott and became very popular several girls thought the book was more than fantastic. The immediate popularity astonished both Louisa and her publisher. 
                  The novel describes the lives of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, as they grow from girls to women. It is regarded as an autobiographical or semi-autobiographical work because it is loosely based on the author's life and the lives of her three sisters.
                  While their father has been enlisted to fight in the Civil War, the four Marches live in poverty in New England with their mother. The sisters embark on a series of adventures and face a multitude of catastrophes, all of which help to reveal their personalities.

                <p class="card__price-value">The French Revolution was fought, Marie Antoinette was guillotined, and Napoleon rose to power and controlled most of Western Europe all between 1797, when a young Jane Austen began work on what would become Pride and Prejudice, and 1813, when the novel was published. Closer to Austen's home, Great Britain and Ireland merged to form the United Kingdom, the slave trade was abolished by Parliament across the British empire, and King George III was replaced in his duties by his son, the Prince Regent, later to become King George IV, after he appeared to be driven insane by what historians now believe was a rare hereditary metabolic disorder. In many ways, the Georgian era, into which Jane Austen was born, was a transitional moment for Britain, which was characterized by nearly continual warfare overseas. It witnessed the start of the Industrial Revolution, the transition from Enlightenment to Romantic styles in art and literature, and the first echoes of feminist and abolitionist concerns in Western Europe. Understanding the specific realities of daily living during the Regency period, as faced by Austen and so many of her fictional characters, can help put Austen's domestic fictions in context.</p>

                <p class="card__price-only">Background <br> Jane Eyre</p>
                <div class="scroll">
                <p class="card__price-value">Charlotte Brontë's novel Jane Eyre was initially published in 1847 as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, with Currer Bell (Brontë's pen name) listed as the editor. With its realistic portrayal of a woman's inner existence, emphasizing her battles with her natural urges and social circumstances, it is widely regarded as a masterpiece, bringing fresh honesty to the Victorian novel. Despite some criticism that it was anti-Catholic, the piece was a huge hit right away. Jane Eyre's success resulted in part by the fact that it was written in the first person and frequently addressed the reader, offering it a sense of importance. Jane is also an unusual heroine, an independent and self-reliant woman who overcomes adversity as well as cultural standards. The work also included a unique combination of genres. Jane's decision between sexual urge and ethical obligation is strongly rooted in the moral realism approach. However, her narrow escape from a bigamous marriage and Bertha's fiery death are part of the Gothic tradition.</p>
